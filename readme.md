# 🗂️ Structure for Completing Homework Assignments

## ⚙️ How to Work:

1. Make a copy of the repository (fork or clone).
2. Place your implementation code inside the `implementation` folder.
3. Commit your changes and push to the remote repository using `git push`.

## 💡 Code Upload Guidelines:

- Do **not** upload the `node_modules` folder to the repository.
- Do **not** include the `.env` file — make sure it's listed in `.gitignore`.
